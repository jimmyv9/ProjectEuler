# ProjectEuler
Solutions to problems posed by ProjectEuler.net.

# main.py
Running this module, allows you to enter which problem you are trying to find a numerical solution to.

# ProjectEuler.py
Algorithms for specific solutions, along with comments and a brief description for each individual problem can be found in there. For complete descriptions of problems access https://projecteuler.net/archives

# helper.py
Specific functions that were used multiple times across different EulerProject solutions (e.g. Erasthotenes sieve, prime number decomposition, etc.)

# Extra .txt files
These files are labeled with the problem number they are used in, and are essential in finding the correct solution.
